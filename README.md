In the digital marketing and retail sectors, enhancing customer engagement and reducing hesitation in purchasing decisions remain significant challenges.
In online shopping, especially for furniture, customers often struggle to imagine how a product will look in their own space. 
This uncertainty can lead to hesitation and sometimes even returns. To help solve this problem, this project uses Augmented Reality (AR) to let customers tap on a furniture item and see it in their own environment through their phone or tablet.
By allowing customers to visualize products in real life, this feature aims to make online shopping easier, increase confidence in purchases, and improve the overall shopping experience on e-commerce websites.
The details about the project and its execution were mentioned in the FURNITURE_AR.pdf file
Download the apk files attached here in the project in AR supported mobile devices and install it to run in your mobile devices.
